# journals-on-twitter

Here is a dataset of 3.474 Twitter accounts pertaining to a sample of 13.822 distinct journals listed in Web of Scienceâ€™s three major indices (SCIE, SSCI and AHCI).

The data were collected in the first quarter of 2022, with sporadic updates ever since.

Follower counts are retrieved in the beginning of each month since August 2022 (though December 2022 was mistakenly omitted; and July 2023 was omitted due to problems with the API following a policy change at Twitter).

The dataset is available under a Creative Commons-license (CC0).
